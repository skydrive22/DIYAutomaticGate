# DIYAutomaticGate
Automatic gate utilizing the RAW620 motors from a mighty mule MM362 kit. Running on an ESP8266 and coding through ESPhome. 

The goal is to create a gate to open, close, and stop when a button is pushed and will later be expanded to utilize RF keypads to activate. 

Current BOM is uploaded as an excel sheet. Note that this build could be significantly cheaper with some minor changes to interface.
